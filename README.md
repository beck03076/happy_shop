# Happy Shop

Welcome to the Happy Shop, we have a huge list of products and we are a public API service to fetch these products based on a lot of filters.

This is a ruby on rails --api project built with rails 5, postgresql, elasticsearch, sidekiq and many other interesting tools that forms a really holistic tech stack.

Following TDD practice, designed with few useful patterns, styled with rubocop style guide, documented with yard convention, lines of code analysis, 97% tests coverage and properly error handled rails project could be very useful to assess one's knowledge in building rails api projects.
